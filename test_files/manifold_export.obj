# Non-manifold vertex example
o NonManifoldVertexExample

# Vertices
v 0.0 0.0 0.0   # Vertex 1 (shared non-manifold vertex)
v 1.0 0.0 0.0   # Vertex 2
v 0.0 1.0 0.0   # Vertex 3
v -1.0 0.0 0.0  # Vertex 4
v 0.0 -1.0 0.0  # Vertex 5

# Faces
f 1 2 3          # Triangle 1
f 1 3 4          # Triangle 2
f 1 4 5          # Triangle 3
f 1 5 2          # Triangle 4

# Note: Vertex 1 is shared by four triangles, forming a non-manifold configuration.
