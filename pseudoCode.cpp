well, the key is to have a isometric preserved mapping from source to target. unfortunately, 
such mapping is not always possible, therefore we need to find some good approximation. 
barycentric coordinate can do it if you can break both source and target into similar tiles 
(could be a low detailed mesh or some volumes) and map all points in one tile of the source to the corresponding one of the target.
 it may not work out well if you treat the whole mesh together.  
 Also, it will be hard to have both tile partitions in the same number and with good correspondence- 
 so the tiling may need to be done manually or design some clever way to do it.

This paper may provide some details to explain how to find the shape correspondence.

Summary of Steps Involving Discrete Laplacians:
Compute Barycentric Coordinates: For each vertex in the source mesh, 
you compute its barycentric coordinates relative to the guidance curves (as described in your pseudocode). 
These coordinates will help define how each vertex is mapped to the target geometry.

Define Boundary Conditions: The boundary vertices are fixed by the source curves, 
and these act as boundary conditions for the Laplacian computation.

Compute Discrete Laplacians: Using cotangent weights or other weighting schemes, 
compute the discrete Laplacian for the interior vertices, ensuring that the geometry of the mesh transitions smoothly between boundary points.

Solve for Interior Points: The interior points are computed by solving a system of equations that enforces smoothness, 
ensuring that the transformation respects both the geometry of the source and target meshes.

Validate Mapping: Finally, validate that the computed solution respects the initial mapping and the constraints imposed by the source curves.
